# -Multimodal-image-caption-generation-using-deep-learning
Description:<br>
This project implements deep learning techniques to generate captions for images. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from images and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating descriptive captions. The model is trained on a dataset of images with corresponding captions to learn the relationship between visual content and textual descriptions.

Key Features:

Utilizes pre-trained CNN models such as VGG16 for feature extraction.
Implements RNN architecture, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for caption generation.
Provides multi-language caption translation using external translation APIs.
Supports audio conversion of generated captions for accessibility.
Incorporates pause, stop, resume functionalities for audio playback.
Offers Flask-based web application deployment for interactive usage.
Implements a user-friendly Jupyter notebook interface for experimentation and development.
